## AirBnB clone - Web static

### An Airbnb clone - web static refers to a static version of a website that mimics the functionality and design of the popular accommodation booking platform Airbnb. A static website means that the content and pages are pre-designed and don't have dynamic features like user authentication, real-time search, or booking functionality.

In the context of an Airbnb clone, a web static version would typically include the following features:

Homepage: A visually appealing landing page that showcases popular destinations or featured properties. It may also have a search bar to allow users to search for properties based on location, date, and other filters.

Property Listing Page: This page displays the properties available for booking. Each property will have a brief description, photos, amenities, pricing details, and a booking button or contact information to get in touch with the property owner.

Search Functionality: Users can search for properties based on their desired location, check-in and check-out dates, number of guests, and other relevant filters. The search results page will display a list of properties that match the search criteria.

Property Details: When a user clicks on a property from the search results or property listing page, they can view detailed information about the property, including additional photos, a more extensive description, reviews, and ratings.

Contact and Booking: Users can get in touch with the property owner or manager to inquire about availability, ask questions, or make a booking. The contact information may include phone numbers, email addresses, or a contact form.
